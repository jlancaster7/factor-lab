---

---

## Epic 2: Time-Aware Data Processing
### Story 2.1: Accepted Date Handling ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Implementation Status**: Hybrid approach implemented with comprehensive testing

**Key Challenge Identified**: Financial ratios lack `acceptedDate` field because they're calculated from underlying statements

**Solution: Hybrid Approach (Option 3)**
- [x] ✅ Parse `acceptedDate` field from all statements (income, balance sheet, cash flow)
- [x] ✅ Implement `_filter_by_accepted_date(data, as_of_date, use_fiscal_date_fallback=True)` method
- [x] ✅ Ensure no look-ahead bias in data selection with acceptedDate <= as_of_date filtering
- [x] ✅ Add validation that acceptedDate <= as_of_date with proper logging
- [x] ✅ Handle timezone issues with date normalization
- [x] ✅ **HYBRID FALLBACK**: Fiscal date + 75-day lag for financial ratios without acceptedDate
- [x] ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Created test_accepted_date.py and test_multi_statement_accepted_date.py

**Implementation Details:**
- **Primary Method**: Uses acceptedDate when available (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements)
- **Fallback Method**: Uses fiscal date + 75-day conservative lag for financial ratios
- **Parameters**: 
  - `use_fiscal_date_fallback: bool = True` (enables fallback)
  - `fiscal_lag_days: int = 75` (conservative estimate for SEC filing delays)
- **Validation Results**: 100% success rate on all 4 statement types with proper fallback behavior

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
def _filter_by_accepted_date(self, data: List[Dict], as_of_date: Union[str, datetime], 
                           use_fiscal_date_fallback: bool = True, fiscal_lag_days: int = 75) -> List[Dict]
```

**Rationale for Hybrid Approach:**
1. **Statement Coverage**: 3/4 FMP statement types have acceptedDate (income, balance, cash flow)
2. **Financial Ratios Gap**: Ratios calculated from statements lack acceptedDate metadata
3. **Conservative Fallback**: 75-day lag provides reasonable protection against look-ahead bias
4. **Future-Proof**: Sets foundation for Story 2.2 smart statement mapping approach

### Story 2.2: Trailing 12-Month Calculations + Smart Financial Ratio acceptedDate Mapping ✅ **98% COMPLETED** 
**Enhanced Scope**: Combines trailing 12M calculations with intelligent acceptedDate resolution for financial ratios

**🎉 FULLY IMPLEMENTED Core Features:**
- [x] ✅ **TTM Data Calculation**: `_get_trailing_12m_data(symbol, as_of_date, include_balance_sheet, min_quarters)` method
- [x] ✅ **Income Statement Aggregation**: `_sum_income_statement_quarters()` sums 4 quarters correctly  
- [x] ✅ **Balance Sheet Integration**: Most recent balance sheet data properly integrated (2023-09-30 for AAPL as of 2024-01-01)
- [x] ✅ **Financial Ratio Calculations**: 6/8 ratios now calculating successfully (debt_to_equity, ROE, ROA, current_ratio, margins)
- [x] ✅ **Period Parameter Support**: All fetching methods enhanced for annual/quarterly data
- [x] ✅ **Smart acceptedDate Mapping**: Intelligent ratio timing based on underlying statements
- [x] ✅ **Comprehensive Metadata**: quarters_used, calculation_successful, balance_sheet_date tracking

**✅ DEBUGGING ISSUES RESOLVED (June 1, 2025):**
- [x] ✅ **Future Date Filtering Bug**: FIXED - Added current date constraint preventing analysis dates > current date
  ```
  Future analysis date detected: 2030-01-01 > current date 2025-06-01. 
  Factor analysis cannot be performed for future dates.
  ```
- [x] ✅ **Balance Sheet Data Availability**: FIXED - Increased fetch limit from 4 to 20 records for sufficient historical data
- [x] ✅ **TTM Integration**: COMPLETE - Balance sheet properly filtered and integrated with TTM calculations

**📊 FINAL TEST RESULTS (June 1, 2025):**
- ✅ **TTM Calculation**: PASSING - 4 quarters aggregated correctly (Revenue: $383.3B, Net Income: $97.0B)
- ✅ **Balance Sheet Data**: PASSING - Available as of 2024-01-01 (Assets: $352.6B, Equity: $62.1B)
- ✅ **Financial Ratios**: 6/8 SUCCESSFUL - debt_to_equity (1.994), ROE (1.561), ROA (0.275), current_ratio (0.988), margins
- ✅ **Future Date Filtering**: PASSING - Correctly rejects 2030-01-01 analysis date  
- ✅ **Look-Ahead Bias Prevention**: PASSING - 2021-01-01 correctly limited to 2/4 quarters
- ✅ **Invalid Symbol Handling**: PASSING - Graceful error handling

**⚠️ MINOR REMAINING ITEMS (2% remaining):**
- [ ] **PE Ratio**: Requires market cap data (stock price × shares outstanding) - external market data needed
- [ ] **PB Ratio**: Requires market cap data (stock price × shares outstanding) - external market data needed

**🎯 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
```python
# Core TTM calculation with future date prevention
def _get_trailing_12m_data(self, symbol: str, as_of_date: Union[str, datetime], 
                          include_balance_sheet: bool = True, min_quarters: int = 4) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Income statement quarter aggregation  
def _sum_income_statement_quarters(self, quarters: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, float]

# Smart ratio timing based on underlying statements
def _get_smart_ratio_accepted_date(self, ratio_name: str, symbol: str, as_of_date: Union[str, datetime]) -> Optional[datetime]

# Complete financial ratio calculation with timing
def _calculate_financial_ratios_with_timing(self, symbol: str, as_of_date: Union[str, datetime], ratios_to_calculate: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**🔧 Key Implementation Details:**

## Key Technical Decisions and Insights

### Epic 2 Decision: Hybrid Approach for acceptedDate Handling

**Problem Discovered**: Financial ratios from FMP API lack `acceptedDate` fields because they're calculated metrics derived from underlying financial statements.

**Analysis of FMP Data Structure**:
- ✅ **Income Statements**: Have acceptedDate (e.g., "2024-11-01")
- ✅ **Balance Sheets**: Have acceptedDate (e.g., "2024-11-01") 
- ✅ **Cash Flow Statements**: Have acceptedDate (e.g., "2024-11-01")
- ❌ **Financial Ratios**: Missing acceptedDate (calculated from underlying statements)

**Evaluated Options**:
1. **Skip Financial Ratios**: Calculate all ratios manually from statements
2. **Use Fiscal Date Only**: Apply uniform lag to all data types
3. **Hybrid Approach**: acceptedDate when available, fiscal date + lag fallback ✅ **CHOSEN**

**Implementation Decision: Option 3 - Hybrid Approach**
- **Rationale**: Maximizes data accuracy while maintaining look-ahead bias protection
- **Primary Path**: Use acceptedDate for statements (3/4 data types)
- **Fallback Path**: Use fiscal date + 75-day lag for financial ratios
- **Future Evolution**: Story 2.2 will add smart statement mapping for precise ratio timing

**Validation Results**:
- **Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite (test_accepted_date.py, test_multi_statement_accepted_date.py)
- **Success Rate**: 100% filtering success across all 4 FMP statement types
- **Fallback Behavior**: Properly handles missing acceptedDate with fiscal date + lag
- **Look-Ahead Protection**: Confirmed no future data leakage in filtered results

**Story 2.2 Enhancement Plan**:
Will implement intelligent acceptedDate resolution for financial ratios by mapping each ratio to its underlying statement dependencies:
- Debt/Equity → Balance Sheet acceptedDate
- ROE → max(Income Statement, Balance Sheet acceptedDate)  
- PE Ratio → Income Statement acceptedDate
- Current Ratio → Balance Sheet acceptedDate

This hybrid foundation enables both immediate look-ahead bias protection and future precision improvements.

### Epic 5 Discovery: Fiscal Quarter Alignment Issue and Solution

**Problem Discovered**: The initial implementation of `get_fundamental_factors()` used `pd.date_range(freq='QE')` which assumes calendar quarters (Q1=Mar 31, Q2=Jun 30, Q3=Sep 30, Q4=Dec 31). However, many companies have non-standard fiscal years:
- Apple (AAPL): Fiscal year ends September
- Microsoft (MSFT): Fiscal year ends June  
- Walmart (WMT): Fiscal year ends January

**Impact**: 
1. Missing data for assumed calendar quarters that don't exist
2. Inefficient API calls for non-existent quarters
3. Incorrect TTM calculations using wrong quarter boundaries

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Old approach (problematic)
quarterly_dates = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='QE')

# New approach (correct) - fetch actual reporting dates first
sample_statements = self._fetch_income_statement(symbol, limit=20, period="quarter")
fiscal_dates = [pd.to_datetime(stmt['date']) for stmt in validated_statements]
```

**Benefits**:
- Uses company's actual fiscal calendar
- Only requests data for quarters that exist
- Properly aligns with company-specific reporting schedules
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Ensures accurate TTM calculations

This improvement was implemented in the `get_fundamental_factors()` method as part of Epic 5.
