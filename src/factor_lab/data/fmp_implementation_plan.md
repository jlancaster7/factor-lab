---

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive FMPProvider class to fetch real fundamental data for factor analysis, replacing the simulated data in the fundamental_factors.ipynb notebook.

## Key Requirements
- **No Look-Ahead Bias**: Use `acceptedDate` to ensure only publicly available data is used
- **Trailing 12-Month Calculations**: Sum 4 most recent quarters for all metrics
- **Rate Limiting**: 750 API calls per minute
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache by ticker and date with acceptedDate awareness
- **Modular Design**: Consistent with existing DataProvider architecture

- [x] ✅ **BONUS**: Fixed quality scoring algorithm to properly score based on record-level issues

**Completed Features:**
- Comprehensive data validation with proper type conversion and null handling
- Robust date parsing that strips time components for consistency
- Data quality scoring system that correctly identifies problematic data (40% score for test data with issues)
- Test coverage in `/tests/test_validation_methods.py` and `/tests/test_data_quality.py`
- Handles all 4 data types (income_statement, balance_sheet, cash_flow, financial_ratios)
